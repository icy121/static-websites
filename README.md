#       Let's go!
__A guide to traverse or make changes ( Don't mess anything up )__


###     Coding guidelines!

    -> Make it readable! Divide in sections.
    -> More blocks are always good.
    -> Follow cases and naming conventions!
        -   camelCase for preferably everything
        -   snake_case for prettier code
        -   kebab-case
        -   All caps for MACROS
    -> DO NOT HARD CODE!!!!
    -> Use builtin functions
    -> Comment about everything
    -> Document everything!
    -> Add a banner at the top of each file
    -> Use modules but don't overuse them
    -> DON'T DELAY REFACTORING
    -> Consider convenience ( to change the code )
